## What is CycleGAN ?


CycleGAN is an artificial intelligence model that performs image transformation between two different domains (e.g., horse and zebra images). The model contains a generator and a discriminator for each domain. While the generators transform images from one domain to the other, the discriminators distinguish whether these images are real or generated.

CycleGAN uses cycle-consistency to ensure that an image, when transformed to the other domain and then back to its original form, remains consistent with its initial appearance. This allows transformations such as converting horse images to zebra images or day photos to night photos.
